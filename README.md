## Interests
* Game design - I love analyzing the design of video games, and I would like to try game development as a hobby if I have the time.
* Software development - More of a generalized goal than an interest, but I am interested in going into software development as a career, though I am still exploring what companies I want to work for or specific kinds of software I want to focus on.
* Streaming - I picked up this hobby over the summer with some of my friends. I stream games on Twitch for fun in my free time.

## Technical Background
I only got into computer science when starting college, as it was something that interested me but I had never gotten a chance to experience in school. ALmost all of my programming experience has come from about the past two years; I was direct-admitted into the CIS program at GVSU, and I began CS core classes in my first semester.
As a result, I have the most experienced in Java, though I have also worked with C, Python, and JavaScript for classes, and I have also used Linux and git in more recent courses I have taken.
Aside from the required CS classes, I took CIS 657 (Mobile Application Development) over the summer as one of my first elective courses. I have previously taken CIS 350, so I am familiar with most of the software engineering terminology we have been discussing in this class.
